# Hey Day Script  
Hey! This script will greet the user (and their friends)!

## What is Hey Day?  
HeyDay is a tradition that started in 1947 at Auburn.

## Functionality in this Script  
This script uses several concepts we learned in class.

### While loop  
The while loop is used to ask the user for input indefinitely by setting the test to true.
```bash
while true; do
	echo "Hey"
done
```

This wil create an infinite loop unless another condition is used.

### If statement  
An if statement is used to exit the script and prevent an infinite loop.

## Use  
1. Run the script by ./hey_day.sh
2. Enter your name(s)
3. Once you've had fun say "Bye" to exit the script
